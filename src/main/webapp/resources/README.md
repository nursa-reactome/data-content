# Important information regarding the AutoComplete

Javascript: the file that controls the auto completion (search-ac.js) resides in the {Website}/templates/favourite/js/autocomplete
CSS: the file autocomplete.css resides in the {Website}/templates/favourite/css/autocomplete

The reason why these files are not here is because we don't want to open up a session with this project just to get them.
This may reduce the number of open sessions.
